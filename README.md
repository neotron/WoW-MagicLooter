# Magic Looter for WoW 

## What is Magic Looter?</strong>

Magic Looter is an addon to make master looting easier to manage. Specifically it will automatically loot Bind-on-Equip or non-binding items to a configured prioritized set of players (based on who's in the raid).

There are two recipient lists - bank items and disenchanting. Every time you open the loot windows, Magic Looter will scan the item(s) and using the predefined lists will send the item(s) to the appropriate recipient(s). If none of the players on the predefined list are available as loot recipients, the item will be looted to yourself.

*Note:* The addon **only** useful for master looting. It doesn't do anything when master looting isn't active.

Also note that it is best used when the loot threshold is set to uncommon. It can be used with any threshold, but the higher the threshold, the lower the benefit of automatic looting is.

## Is that it?

No, there's also an optional addon that replaces the Master Loot menu. It adds class sorted looting (instead of group based), random roll tracking and quick looting to self, disenchanter or banker.

## Why do I need this?

I wrote this because my guild collect all greens for disenchanting, later used to provide free enchants to raiders, and I got tired of manually distribute master loot items.
